 M.Sc. course at the Reichman University <br/>
 Lecturer and guide - Dr. Oren Laadan <br/>
## Intro

This program is a part of our 3rd assignment. <br/>
Check out [os-hw3/assignment-3.md](https://github.com/GlaiChen/os-hw3/blob/main/assignment-3.md) for full details of the assignment. <br/>
This program is only the invidual part, and the group part will appear at //%%%%// from our repo at the following link: <br/>https://github.com/academy-dt/adv-os-linux/tree/ex3 <br/>

## Invidual Part - Kernel Virtual Machine
In several lectures in the course, we have learned about virtualization from most of aspects. <b/r>
(1) In Lecture #9, we've been shown by Dr. Laadan 2 mechanisms (you can find it [here](https://github.com/GlaiChen/os-hw3/blob/main/AOS-2022-L09.pdf), at slides 26 && 27). <br/>
The first mechanism is of KVM as despicted in slide 26: <br/><br/>

First, it is Type II hypervisor, which means it is a hosted hypervisor, which suppurt guest virtual machines by coordinating calls for CPU, memory and other resources through the physical host's operating system. In simple words -type II runs on top of an OS.
